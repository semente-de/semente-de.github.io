  					semente builds on knowledge exchange in projects such as [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki) and [ID21](https://fonte.wiki/id21). It is informed by decades of digital rights activism in Brazil and the intention to regenerate fair and inclusive futures with the critical appropriation of digital technologies.


            Semente had a series of feedback sessions during the 2022 edition of [Tropixel](https://tropixel.org) in Ubatuba, Brazil.
