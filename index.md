semente builds on knowledge exchange in projects such as [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki) and [ID21](https://fonte.wiki/id21). It is informed by decades of digital rights activism in Brazil and the intention to regenerate fair and inclusive futures with the critical appropriation of digital technologies.

Semente went through a series of feedback sessions:
 - at the 2022 edition of [Tropixel](https://tropixel.org) in Ubatuba, Brazil (July 2022).
 - at the [MozFest](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/TNZJ3K/) (March 2023).
 - during the launch of Critical Infrastructure Lab in Amsterdam (April 2023).
